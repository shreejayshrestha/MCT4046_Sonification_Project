## Acknowledgement
We are very grateful to Anna Xambo, our teacher for the MCT4046 Sonification and Sound Design course for exposing us to many experts and professionals working in the areas of sonification and sound design through this course. We would also like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to Thomas Hermann for sharing his plethora of knowledge on sonification and also for providing us with his slides and python script which helped us practice/learn sonification technique through this project.

Thank you.

On behalf of the team, 
Shreejay.
