# MCT4046_Sonification_Project

## Introduction
This is a group project in MCT4046 Sonification and Sound Design course at the MCT programme(NTNU & UiO). We chose to analyse Traffic data (MotorBike, CarTaxies and BusCoaches) of thre three regions in England (North East, South East &  West Midland) via Parameter Mapping Sonification Technique.

## Description of Files/Folders
#### Data Files
This folder contains all the raw data of the traffic data of three regions. It also contains the matlab script used to refine the data and the final data in .xls, .csv and .json file format. The raw files are downloaded from https://www.dft.gov.uk/traffic-counts/download.


#### Final Sound Files
It contains all the sonification sound files in .wav file format.

The file contains the synths made for the project in super collidor.

The script is written in jupyter notebook. It reads the data, maps certain synths to different parameters of the data, creates the sonification and finally records the sound files in .wav file format. It utilizes the <a href="https://github.com/thomas-hermann/sc3nb" target="_blank">sc3nb module</a> for python/jupyter notebook developed by <a href="https://sonification.de/thermann/" target="_blank">Thomas Hermann</a>. The script is also inspired by the two days of lecture and hands on practice on sonification by Thomas using python and the sc3nb module for python/jupyter notebook.

## Acknowledgement
We are very grateful to Anna Xambo, our teacher for the MCT4046 Sonification and Sound Design course for exposing us to many experts and professionals working in the areas of sonification and sound design. We would also like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to Thomas Hermann for sharing his plethora of knowledge on sonification and also for providing us with his slides and python script which helped us practice/learn sonification technique through this project.

Thank you.
