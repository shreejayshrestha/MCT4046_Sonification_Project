## Introduction
This is the repository for our group project in MCT4046 Sonification and Sound Design course at the MCT programme(NTNU & UiO). 
It contains all the files for the project which are briefly described below;

## Description of Files/Folders
#### Data Files
This folder contains four sub folders- compiled dataset, javascript, matlab script and raw csv data. Compiled dataset contains the refined data, javascript cotains the code for first prototype, matlab script contsins the matlab script for refining the raw data and the raw scv data contains the raw data of the traffic data of three regions downloaded from https://www.dft.gov.uk/traffic-counts/download.


#### Final Sound Files
It contains all the sonification sound files in .wav file format for both of the prototypes.

#### list of sounds for mapping.csd
The file contains the synths for the second prototype made in super collidor.

#### sonification project 17 april 019.ipynb
This is the script for second prototype written in python/jupyter notebook. It reads the refined data, maps certain synths to different parameters of the data, creates the sonification and finally records the sound files in .wav file format. It utilizes the <a href="https://github.com/thomas-hermann/sc3nb" target="_blank">sc3nb module</a> for python/jupyter notebook developed by <a href="https://sonification.de/thermann/" target="_blank">Thomas Hermann</a>. The script is also inspired by the two days of lecture and hands on practice on sonification by Thomas using python and the sc3nb module for python/jupyter notebook.

## Acknowledgement
We are very grateful to Anna Xambo, our teacher for the MCT4046 Sonification and Sound Design course for exposing us to many experts and professionals working in the areas of sonification and sound design through this course. We would also like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to Thomas Hermann for sharing his plethora of knowledge on sonification and also for providing us with his slides and python script which helped us practice/learn sonification technique through this project.

Thank you.

On behalf of the team, 
Shreejay.
